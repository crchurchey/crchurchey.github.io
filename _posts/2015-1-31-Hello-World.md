title: Hello World!

My first post using <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> and Barry Clark's <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now" target="_blank">jekyll-now</a> template. The jekyll-now template is a great way to get a simple blog site up and running using GitHub Pages; just fork his repo, rename it, and edit <code>_config.yaml</code>.

I plan on using this blog tool to store information that is important/useful to me:

 * Installation and configuration guides for tools and OS' that I use
 * Links to information that I find useful or interesting
 * Random thoughts...probably not but who knows.

 Stay tuned!
