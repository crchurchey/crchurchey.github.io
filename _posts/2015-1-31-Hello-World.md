My first post using <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> and Barry Clark's <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now" target="_blank">jekyll-now</a> template. The jekyll-now template is a great way to get a simple blog site up and running using GitHub Pages and jekyll; just fork his repo, rename it, and edit <code>_config.yaml</code>. Here are some of the features you get with simple configuration of this template:

 * Various Social Media Footer links just by setting your username/handle in <code>_config.yaml</code>
 * <a href="http://disqus.com" target="_blank">Disqus</a> commenting support on blog posts
 * <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> support
 * Super quick and fairly easy way to get a blog up and running for free

I plan on using this blog tool to store information that is important/useful to me:

 * Installation and configuration guides for tools and OS' that I use
 * Links to information that I find useful or interesting
 * Random thoughts...probably not but who knows.

 Stay tuned!
